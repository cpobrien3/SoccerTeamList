# SoccerTeamList
This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of using JPA joins. For this project, I created a division entity that has a ManyToOne relationship with my soccer team entity. I then created servlets and JSPs that allows a user to create a new division with teams, view the divisions from a list, and delete a division from a list.
