# SoccerTeamList
This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of JPA. For this project, I created a SoccerTeam object that had the properties clubName, league, city, and country. 
I then added annotations and inputs into the class to make an entity class that can work with Persistence. Using this class, I created a console-based program that allows entities
to be created, edited, and deleted from a database.
