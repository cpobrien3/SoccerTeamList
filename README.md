# SoccerTeamList
This project was created to demonstrate my understanding of using JPA, JSPs, and servlets. For this project, I used my SoccerTeam and SoccerTeamHelper classes that utilized JPA. After converting that project into a dynamic web project, I created and utilized servlets and JSPs to allow a user to add, edit, delete, or view soccer teams.
